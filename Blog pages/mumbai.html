          The Gateway of India, located in South Mumbai, is an iconic arch-monument overlooking the Arabian Sea. Built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India in 1911, its construction was completed in 1924. Designed in the Indo-Saracenic architectural style with influences of Gujarati and Islamic designs, the structure stands 26 meters tall, crafted from yellow basalt and reinforced concrete.  

          Historically, the Gateway served as the ceremonial entrance for British Viceroys and dignitaries. It also marked a significant moment in history when the last British troops left India in 1948, symbolizing the end of colonial rule. Today, the monument is a popular tourist attraction and a gathering spot, offering stunning views of the sea and the nearby Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. It stands as a reminder of Mumbai's colonial past and its vibrant present.
